Integrates with ledger canister qroj6-lyaaa-aaaam-qeqta-cai (ICRC-2 standard) and ICPSwap pool canister wkyqn-qqaaa-aaaar-qbyxq-cai for live price data. Features: transaction history (last 100, paginated 25 per page) with continuous indexing (polls every 5 minutes, stores from deployment forward), address search with balance lookup, live ICP price per token (format: '1 BITTYICP = < 0.00001 ICP'), supply metrics (999,999,999.92M total/circulating), 2D animated BITTY coin with rolling animation using CSS (rolls across screen in 5 seconds, stops at center for 5 seconds, repeats), and holder section displaying all holders with balances and percentage of total supply held (compiled from transaction history analysis).",
