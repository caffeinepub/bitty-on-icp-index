  "summary": "The diff only modifies `project_state.json` (a metadata/state tracking file), recording the fix request as 'pending'. The actual Motoko backend fix in `backend/main.mo` — which is the sole requirement — has not been implemented at all.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "In backend/main.mo, fix the RTS error: blob_of_principal: invalid principal crash by (1) validating principals before calling principal-related functions, (2) skipping transactions with invalid/anonymous/minting principals, and (3) ensuring the function returns remaining valid transactions without throwing.",
      "reason": "The diff contains no changes to backend/main.mo. Only project_state.json was modified, and the feature status is recorded as 'pending', confirming the actual code fix was not applied.",
